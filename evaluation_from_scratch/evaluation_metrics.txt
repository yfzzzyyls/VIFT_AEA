VIFT FROM SCRATCH EVALUATION RESULTS
=====================================

Translation Error (cm):
  Mean:   3.93
  Std:    8.19
  Median: 1.25
  95%:    13.69
  Max:    76.80

Rotation Error (degrees):
  Mean:   62.41
  Std:    45.30
  Median: 40.74
  95%:    145.88
  Max:    179.84

Note: High rotation error is expected due to Euler angle representation.
Consider using quaternion representation for better results.
