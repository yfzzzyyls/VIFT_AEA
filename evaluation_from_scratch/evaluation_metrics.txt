VIFT FROM SCRATCH EVALUATION RESULTS
=====================================

Translation Error (cm):
  Mean:   3.16
  Std:    3.78
  Median: 1.69
  95%:    10.22
  Max:    27.97

Rotation Error (degrees):
  Mean:   2.10
  Std:    2.92
  Median: 1.29
  95%:    5.79
  Max:    62.08

Note: High rotation error is expected due to Euler angle representation.
Consider using quaternion representation for better results.
